An extensible XMPP Bot written in Python 3
- based on the SleekXMPP module

The built-in "Plugin Manager" enables you to load/reload plugins on the fly as the bot is running, simply write:
".load example" to the bot, and it will load "example.py" in the "scripts" directory.

There is also .reload and .unload (self explanatory)

-------------

Edit config.py to change the settings
Example scripts (and working ones) are added too.

Requirements:

- Python 3.x → http://python.org
- SleekXMPP → https://github.com/fritzy/SleekXMPP

Features:
- Plugin Support (loading/reloading during runtime)
